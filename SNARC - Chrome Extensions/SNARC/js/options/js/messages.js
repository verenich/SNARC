        "en": "The Internet has created a paradigm shift in how we consume and disseminate information. Data nowadays is spread over heterogeneous silos of archived and live data. People willingly share data on social media by posting news, views, presentations, pictures and videos. Social media has become a source of live and up-to-date knowledge; a property that was lacking in traditional sources. <br/> SNARC is a service that uses semantic web technology and combines services available on the web to aggregate social news. SNARC brings live and archived information to the user that is directly related to his active page. The key advantage is an instantaneous access to complementary information without the need to dig for it.\ Information appears when it is relevant enabling the user to focus on what is really important"

They will now be under renewed pressure over exactly what they knew about him, and whether more could have been done to prevent the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby.\n  \n\t\n\t      The Met Police said it was a planned community event in which a group of people intended to lay a wreath.\n        A small group of English Defence League members also joined the crowd, prompting organisers to complain that their plans had been \"hijacked\".\n        The Kenyan government had previously denied that Mr Adebolajo had ever visited the country, but spokesman Muthui Kariuki said there had been some confusion as he was arrested under a different name.\n        In video footage of his court appearance which emerged on Sunday, Mr Adebolajo is heard to say: \"These people are mistreating us, we are innocent.\" \n        Mr Kariuki told the BBC World Service's Focus on Africa programme that Mr Adebolajo was then handed over to \"British security officers\" when it emerged he was a UK citizen.\n        BBC News East Africa correspondent Gabriel Gatehouse says Mr Adebolajo was detained in late November 2010 on an island off the coast of Kenya, near the Somalia border.\n        But our correspondent says the Kenyan government does not believe he ever reached Somalia.\n        Islamist insurgent group al-Shabab is affiliated to al-Qaeda and is thought to have 7,000 to 9,000 fighters. It killed 76 people in a double bomb attack in Uganda as they watched the 2010 World Cup.   \n        Mr Adebolajo, 28, and a second man, Michael Adebowale, 22, were arrested on suspicion of the murder of Drummer Rigby on 22 May.\n        They remain in custody in hospital in a stable condition after being shot and wounded by police at the scene after the killing. \n        Three further men, aged 21, 24 and 28, were arrested in London on Saturday evening on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder - a Taser was used on two of them.\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                    \n\t\t\n        \r\n            \n                                Please turn on JavaScript.

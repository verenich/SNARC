His partner, who lives with their son, Jack was told of the death on yesterday evening and other members of his family have also been informed.<br \/>Drummer Rigby deployed on operations for the first time to Afghanistan in April 2009 where he served as a member of the Fire Support Group in Patrol Base Woqab. His friends say they find it difficult to accept that he survived that, at a time of often intense fighting, to meet his death in a London street.<br \/>He was later posted to Celle in Germany and then took up a recruitment post at the Regimental Headquarters in the Tower of London, a job to which he was particularly suited, it was considered, because of his sense of empathy and understanding.<br \/>Lieutenant Colonel Jim Taylor MBE, Commanding Officer Second Fusiliers, said today: \u201c He  was a dedicated and professional soldier. He was a real character within the Second Fusiliers. Larger than life, he was at the heart of our Corps of Drums.  An experienced and talented side drummer and machine gunner, he was a true warrior and served with distinction in Afghanistan, Germany and Cyprus.  His ability, talent and personality made him a natural choice to work in the recruiting group.  He will be sorely missed by everyone in the Second Fusiliers. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this incredibly difficult time. Once a Fusilier, Always a Fusilier.\u201d<br \/>&#39;A great character and always smiling&#39;: Friends and colleagues pay tribute to &#39;Riggers&#39;<br \/> Captain Alan Williamson, Adjutant Second Fusiliers (and Drummer Rigby\u2019s Platoon Commander 2010-2011), added: \u201c \u2018Riggers\u2019 as he was known within the Platoon was a cheeky and humorous man, always there with a joke to brighten the mood, he was an extremely popular member of the Fire Support Group (FSG). An excellent side drummer and highly competent machine gunner, he was always there to help out the younger members of the FSG whenever possible.  His loss will be felt across the Battalion but this is nothing compared to how his family must be feeling at this difficult time, our thoughts and prayers are with them..\u201d<br \/>Warrant Officer Class 1 Ned Miller, Regimental Sergeant Major Second Fusiliers, said:  \u201cRiggers is what every Battalion needs. He was one of the Battalion\u2019s great characters always smiling and always ready to brighten the mood with his fellow Fusiliers. He was an excellent drummer and well respected within the Drums platoon. He was easily identified whilst on parade by the huge smile on his face and how proud he was to be a member of the Drums. He would always stop for a chat just to tell me Manchester United would win the league again. My thoughts are with his family and they will always be part of the Fusilier family. Once a Fusilier, always a Fusilier.\u201d<br \/>Vicar Guy Jamieson, who married Drummer Rigby in 2007 to the wife whom he was separated from, at St Anne-in-the-Grove Church in Southowram, West Yorkshire, said : \u201cWhen the news first came through yesterday I felt sickened. It&#39;s abhorrent. We hear a lot about military tragedies overseas but the fact that it was in the street in a city makes it more horrific.<br \/>\u201cI remember his wedding well. He had already spoken to the chaplain at Catterick (Garrison) and came to me well prepared with lots of questions. The wedding day was wonderful. Because it was a military wedding it requires a lot of preparation. I remember sitting next to Lee on the front pew before everything started and reminding him what his first words to say were.\u201d<br \/>Flood of donations crashes charity website<br \/>The website of the charity Help for Heroes crashed after it was deluged with thousands of donations. The military-support group said it had been swamped with thousands of donations following the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, who was wearing one of the charity&#39;s T-shirts when he was attacked on Wednesday. The charity has urged people to donate in other ways.<br \/>Drummer Rigby&#39;s death was met with outrage by colleagues<br \/>Army personnel were initially told to stop wearing their uniforms when off-base for fear of further attacks, but the emergency rules were quickly relaxed following an outcry \u2013 with members of the military changing their social-media profiles to show them in uniform.<br \/>The Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards, said: &quot;There is no reason why we should not wear our uniforms with pride, but on a common-sense basis.&quot;<br \/>Armed-forces personnel based in London and elsewhere were ordered to be more vigilant. The Metropolitan Police said an extra 1,200 officers were to be placed on duty and security at military bases has been stepped up.<br \/>MoD spokesman Jim Nisbet said the advice was a precaution and had been issued as part of a package of &quot;immediate, reactive security-measures&quot;.<br \/>&quot;A decision has been taken to relax some of these temporary measures imposed yesterday, including advice to members of the Armed Forces in London not to wear uniform outside of defence establishments,&quot; he said.<br \/>Paul Bignall<br \/> <br \/><br \/> <br \/>Top story<br \/><br \/>Security services &#39;tried to recruit&#39; Woolwich attack suspect Michael Adebolajo<br \/>IoS EXCLUSIVE Terror suspect was among group arrested in Kenya en route to Somalia two years ago.
